  <h5 class="font-medium">About me</h5>
  <p>
    Hi there, my name is Marcus, and I'm a software engineering student at the Technical University of Denmark with
    a love for everything tech.
  </p>
  <p class="pt-2">
    I have always been fascinated by computers, and especially video games.
    This passion slowly grew into deep love for how software, websites and other feats were created,
    and as such I started creating simple websites and Minecraft Plugins, continuing to improve my skills and
    expand my knowledge and expertise.
  </p>
  <p class="pt-2">
    I have had the pleasure of working on lots of different projects, ranging from simple websites in plain HTML,
    to full-stack web applications and AI models with TensorFlow and PyTorch.
    This website is one of my little side-projects, and the primary objective is for it to function as a proper
    portfolio.
